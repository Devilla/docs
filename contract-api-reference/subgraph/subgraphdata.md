# PNS Subgraph Introduction

PNS has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the PNS smart contracts.

This subgraph can be used to query PNS data.

Subgraph information is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called Indexers.

## GraphQL Schema

The schema of GraphQL elements available is defined in [`/schema.graphql` ](https://github.com/pnsdomains/pns-subgraph/blob/master/schema.graphql)
